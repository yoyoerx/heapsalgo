One day, I read this article https://www.datamation.com/entdev/article.php/616221/How-We-Learned-to-Cheat-at-Online-Poker-A-Study-in-Software-Security.htm and it piqued my interest in exploring further. So I put together this small C program for testing the different shuffle methods described and the method I had been using since I wrote my first blackjack program in highschool.


Method for testing good and bad ways to shuffle along with my ancient (20+ years old) nieve shuffle method.


Compares against a Heap's Algorathim for generating all unique sets through Recursive Permutation.


Also has a quicksort algorithm.
